# Artic Night KDE

A set of themes for KDE Plasma

## Noitice

If you want to use rounded corners, I would recommend install [KDE Rounded Corners](https://github.com/matinlotfali/KDE-Rounded-Corners)

## Install

Run these commands in your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/psyGamer/Arctic-Night-KDE.git
cd Arctic-Night-KDE

chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

If you want the latest version, run: `./update.sh`

If you want to uninstall the themes, run: `./uninstall.sh`
